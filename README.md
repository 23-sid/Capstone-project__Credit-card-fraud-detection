**Problem Statement**

• A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.

• It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

• The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

During Development: In this phase, organize your project files in the following folder structure: project-folder: Name this folder to reflect your project's name in all lowercase, using kebab casing with no spaces in the name.

1. notebooks: This folder should contain Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts where you perform data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
2. data: This folder should contain the dataset(s) used in the project. Include both raw and processed data, along with a README file explaining the dataset's attributes.
3. models: This folder should contain the trained machine learning models or statistical models used in the project. Include model serialization files (e.g., Pickle files) and any model artifacts.
4. visuals: This folder should contain data visualizations and plots generated during exploratory data analysis or model evaluation. Visualizations should be saved as image files (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
5. README.md: This Markdown file should include a detailed description of your project, problem statement, data sources, and explanations of your code and models. Also, provide instructions on how to run your code and reproduce the results.
